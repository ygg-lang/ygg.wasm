/// This structure serves to improve performance over Token objects in two ways:

///   * it is smaller than a Token, leading to both less memory use when stored in the queue but also
///     increased speed when pushing to the queue
///   * it finds its pair in O(1) time instead of O(N), since pair positions are known at parse time
///     and can easily be stored instead of recomputed
